* Python 2.7
* Django >= 1.5
* Python Imaging Library - for image resizing
* South - for database migrations
* Django Taggit
* Django Mptt


Browser Support
---------------

Opps’s admin (used Bootstrap Twitter) interface works with all modern browsers.


Language Translations
---------------------

Opps makes full use of translation strings, which allow Opps to be translated into multiple languages using Django’s internationalization methodology. 
Translations are managed on the `Transiflex <https://www.transifex.com/projects/p/opps/>`_ website but can also be submitted via `GitHub <https://github.com/opps/opps>`_. Consult the documentation for Django’s internationalization methodology for more information on creating translations and using them.
