Language Translations
=====================

Opps makes full use of translation strings, which allow Opps to be translated into multiple languages using Django’s internationalization methodology. 
Translations are managed on the `Transiflex <https://www.transifex.com/projects/p/opps/>`_ website but can also be submitted via `GitHub <https://github.com/opps/opps>`_. Consult the documentation for Django’s internationalization methodology for more information on creating translations and using them.
