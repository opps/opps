Contributing
============

Contributions are very welcome. Specially roles. If you implement a role that you think others might be using, please contribute.

To contribute head to `opps's github page <https://github.com/opps/opps>`_, fork it and create a pull request.


Developing
----------

We strive to keep the internal quality of opps to the best that we can;
Therefore, it's very important to keep some things in mind when contributing with code for opps:

* Test everything you can, with automated tests. If possible, please develop code with `TDD <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test-driven_development>`_.
  If you're having a hard time building tests, don't hesitate to ask for help in the `opps mailing list <http://groups.google.com/group/opps-developers>`_.
  We are happy to help you keep your code well-covered by tests;

* When writing actual code, follow the conventions in `PEP 8 <http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/>`_
  (except for `maximum line length <http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/#maximum-line-length>`_,
  which we don't follow because there are too many parts of the project that require large strings to be used);

* When writing docstrings, follow the conventions in `PEP 257 <http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0257/>`_
  (take a look at other docstrings in the project to get a feel of how we organize them);

  - Also, when writing docstrings for the API, provide examples of how that method or class works.
    Having a code example of a part of the API is really helpful for the user.
